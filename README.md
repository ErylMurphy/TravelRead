TravelRead is Full Crud Express App that recommends books based on the state they are set in. 

This idea came from my recent effort to read the greatest American novels, and my hope to take a cross-country trip in the future. 

Users can submit books that they believe capture the essence of a state. These can be deleted and edited. 

User Story: As a tourist, I want to read a book about the state I am visiting, so that my experience is enriched.

Challenges:

- Navigating the relationships between different folders.
- Creating a text-area with dynamically inserted text on the "Edit" page (in the description).
- Having the state_id automatically apply to a book when it is created. 

Aspirations: 

- To make TravelRead global.
- To utilize an API to make the addition of books easier. 
- To add a page where users can store their reading wishlist.
